I am a genetic epidemiologist interested in the role of both genetic and non-genetic risk factors in the development of Alzheimer’s disease in diverse populations. My research is focused on three major research areas: 1) identifying causal risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) using genomic approaches; 2) understanding the role of mitochondrial genomics in ADRD pathogenesis; and 3) evaluating ancestry specific effects of AD genetic variants on AD endophenotypes. Using large genetic and phenotypic datasets, these research programs combine traditional epidemiological approaches with a variety of statistical genetic techniques including genome-wide association studies, genetic correlations, polygenic risk scores, and Mendelian randomization to determine how modifiable risk factors modify genetic liability to ADRD. Crucially, given AD health disparities across minoritized populations, my recently developed research programs have a specific focus on understanding racial disparities in Alzheimer’s disease health outcomes.
